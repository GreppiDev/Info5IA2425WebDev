Hyperlinks, usually called links, are a foundational concept behind the Web. To explain what links are, we need to step back to the very basics of Web architecture.

Back in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, the Web's inventor, spoke of the three pillars on which the Web stands:

1. [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL), an address system that keeps track of Web documents
2. [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP), a transfer protocol to find documents when given their URLs
3. [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML), a document format allowing for embedded *hyperlinks*
